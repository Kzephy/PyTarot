**"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"** - Arthur C. Clarke


Hello everyone! Thank you for checking out my code, this is my first ever Github project and my first time using the Tkinter and Secrets modules, So I apologize in advance for any GUI "jank".

One of the first things you may notice is I did not use the Random module for this. I instead chose to use the Secrets module because it is a more "cryptographically secure" and "pseudorandom" number generator making it significantly less predictable. The module pulls from your operating systems randomness API giving more unique and esoteric results. This allows for "one of a kind" experiences, propagated by your own hardware!

Since Python code and executable programs are held within your system memory, you may want to purge your memory before each reading to sort of "cleanse" the code and computer. This is totally optional but I think it's important for "spiritual"(?) accuracy. To achieve this, I suggest pulling out your favorite crystals, burning some sage, doing any other ritualistic cleansing activities of your choosing, then performing a system shutdown and reboot. You may also go for something like ISLC (Windows only) (https://www.wagnardsoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1256) to totally purge your memory standby list. Finally, deleting your Pagefile (also Windows) ensures that any "backup" memory is also cleared.

That is all for now, thank you again and happy divining!

**INSTALLER IS NOT WORKING FOR LINUX** I hope to fix this some day...
